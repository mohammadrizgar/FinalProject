            My customer and client relationships are open and honest. I believe that the more upfront and transparent you are with your clients, the more likely they are to return. I most definitely value my clients and am sure to nurture those relationships as much as possible
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I am often the first face, or voice, of the company. I am kind to the clients who call, and they are most often kind in return. We have clients who call in regularly, and we are cordial, asking about each others' weekends, the kids, or the latest hot spots for lunch.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line">I love working with customers. The best part of my day is when I know I made a difference in a customer's experience. In my past job, I often had customers come up to me and just say hello. I feel I develope a fun, respectful relationship with all my customers.
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>I have strong relationships with my clients and customers. I treat them with respect and am sure to utilize their feedback in ways that make myself, and the organization, better

            I love to help my customers! The best part of the day is when a customer comes to me for assistance, and I can guide them to the right product. It builds trust, and I always appreciate return clientele.
